Introduction
************

We took the physical copy of the Administrative glossary and scanned it into a digital document. Performed a few image processing tasks to clean up the document and parse it using OCR. Using the resultant machine readable document, a portal was built.
The portal is a fork of Lexonomy . Written in Python and Javascript.
